In this post, I explain how I set up Git and GitHub on my Linux system and pushed my code step by step.

## First, Understand the Problem

Imagine this situation:

You create a website.

- **Day 1:** It works perfectly.  
- **Day 2:** You change something.  

Now the website breaks.  
You want to go back to yesterday’s version…  
**But you can’t.**

That’s where Git helps.

## What is Git?

**Definition:**  
Git is a version control system that saves your project step by step.

It remembers:
- What you changed  
- When you changed it  
- Who changed it  

**Simple Meaning:**  
Git = Save the history of your project.

### Real-Life Example

Think about a video game. Every time you pass a level, the game saves your progress.  
If you lose, you restart from the last save point.

**Git works the same way.**  
It creates save points for your code.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website where you store your Git projects online.

**Simple Meaning:**

- **Git** = Save on your computer  
- **GitHub** = Save on the internet  

GitHub also allows:
- Collaboration with teams  
- Sharing your code publicly  
- Building a professional portfolio

## Why Must We Learn Git?

Because in real software development:

- Developers work in teams  
- Code is pushed daily  
- Companies rely on version control  
- Almost every tech job requires Git  

**Without Git → No professional development.**

## How Git Actually Works

There are only **3 simple steps**:

1. **Add** – Select files you want to save  
2. **Commit** – Create a save point  
3. **Push** – Upload changes to GitHub  

That’s it.

## Important Git Commands

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `git init` | Start tracking a project |
| `git status` | Check current changes |
| `git add .` | Add all files to staging |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Save changes with a message |
| `git push` | Upload changes to GitHub |

## Final Thoughts

Git is not difficult.  
It only feels confusing at the beginning.

Once you understand:
- Add  
- Commit  
- Push  

You already know the basics of professional development.

Start using Git daily — and you will improve faster than you think.
