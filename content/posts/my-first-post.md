# Welcome 👋

Hello, my name is **Aliyan Abdullah**.

This is my first post on my Hugo blog.  
I built this website to share my journey in programming, Linux, and technology.

I am passionate about learning, building projects, and improving my technical skills every day.  
This blog will document my progress, experiments, and knowledge.

Thank you for visiting my site — more posts are coming soon.
